##### tidyToPān 1.0.0

The name tidyToPān is based on the Greek principle μελέτη τὸ πᾶν (meletē to pān), which roughly translates as "take everything into consideration". Topic modelling helps select the interesting bits from a large corpus of texts while technically having processed every document.

tidyToPān is topic modelling for everyone: from people without programming knowledge to people who want to build teaching and text-reuse tools and apps based on topic-modelling data without having to develop their own tool or having to majorly restructure their textual data. tidyToPān is made to be shared and used. This is why I have modularised tidyToPān in such a way that in each step you can ingest your own data.

tidyToPān is also still under active development, but should be stable. Please let me know if you have any issues.
